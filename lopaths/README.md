# An Algorithm to Compute Locally Optimal Paths for Large-Scale Traffic Models

This package provides an implementation of the algorithm REVC to compute
locally optimal routes between many origins and destinations, as described 
by [Fischer et al. (2019)][REF]. If you use this package 
in research that leads to a scientific publication, we kindly ask you to 
cite the publication.

The package is licensed under the [LGPL-v3][LGPL]. For documentation please refer to
